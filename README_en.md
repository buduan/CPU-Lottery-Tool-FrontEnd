# CPU-Lottery-Tool-FrontEnd
üåç [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](/README.md) | **English**

This is a project developed rather hastily, with actual development starting just two days before use. It was modified on the go as needed. 

To save costs, instead of purchasing a lottery machine, we used an iPad as a substitute tool. This significantly reduced the time required to register prize recipients and verify form completion as per school requirements. The backend has a recording feature that allows for quick export of lottery records. The frontend is still being improved since it will be used again next year. 

It can be deployed on frontend content hosting platforms such as Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, and Tencent Cloud Static Website Hosting.

## Features
